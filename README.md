# React.js lesson

This is the repository for the React.js lesson in the SC CS Club.

# How to proceed

I will cover these lessons in our meeting. Afterwards, you will be able to complete some exercises in two React apps. The folders labeled 'Counter' and 'ToDo list' (the ones without the word solution) are the two apps you will be working on. Once you are done, or, if you get stuck, you can check the solutions. However, it's best to do it on your own!
