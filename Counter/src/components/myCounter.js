// LEVEL 3 - MAKE YOUR OWN

// This is the end of your very first introduction to writing React code. Now you have to implement the comopnent yourself. Start with the boilerplate and go from there.
// Try to challenge yourself and go beyond even the three buttons you implemented in the last component.

// Some challenges:
// 1. Create a button that increments or decrements by different amounts other than 1
// 2. Display some text other than just the 'count' variable
// 3. Don't let the counter go negative (hint: set it to 0 if you are going to decrement below 0)
// 4. Initialize the counter with a number other than 0
// 5. Initialize the counter with a random number each time (hint: Math.floor(Math.random() * max), where 'max' is the maximum number you want to be able to get, will give you a random integer)
// 6. Change the text once you get past a milestone- like a count of 100

// Your code goes here:
