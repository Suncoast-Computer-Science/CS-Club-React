// LEVEL 2 - ADVANCED COUNTER

// This is the advanced counter. It is similar to the basic counter, but we will add some more functionality.

function CounterAdvanced({ count, increment, decrement, reset }) {
  return (
    <div className="CounterAdvanced">
      <h1> Counter Advanced </h1>
      {/* Add a display for the count: */}
      {/* Write code here: */}

      {/* Add a button that increments the counter, just like in the basic example */}
      {/* Write code here: */}

      {/* Add a button that decrements the counter, or subtracts 1 from it: */}
      {/* Write code here: */}

      {/* Add a button that resets the counter to 0: */}
      {/* Write code here: */}
